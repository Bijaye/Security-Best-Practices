# Security-Best-Practices
An Incomplete Security and Privacy Guide for the Masses

##About

This guide is intended to help people who care about their online privacy and security but need more information to make better security aware decisions.

##Goals

Often with security and privacy concerns there exist tradeoffs with usability and complexity. The safest user is often the one who doesn't use the Internet, but if you would like to climb out from under your rock to join us, this guide is here to help you. Getting to a point where you can be reasonably confident in your personal security and privacy online can take a lot of effort, due diligence, and technical vigilance. All of the items in this guide can be overwhelming. Don't treat these items as hard and fast rules to tackle all at once, rather over time do your best to improve your security posture by implementing and trying out more of these practices. Once you have tried many of them out, you can then decide for yourself what your security and privacy needs are compared to your risk tolerance and how inconvenienced it makes your life.
